1)correctness : 
2)completeness :
3)quality : 

Testing: Testing is a process used to identify correctness,completeness and quality of
developed computer software

-> in testing we have to check that expected and actual result should be same

-> Using Testing we can find any gaps, errors or missing requirements

-> Activity
-> Process

SDLC Process
Software Development Lifecycle

Static Testing: Do not execute the code
Dynamic Testing : Execute the code

Once Project will be developed after that test it

When to start testing?
->Once the development will be complete then you can start testing

When to stop testing
->once the error will be solved 


Stages of SDLC
1)Requirement Gathering:
	1)Functional Requirement->Practically We can Perform
	2)Non Funtional Requirement->Practically We can not Perform

->data written format
->data diagram format



2)Analysis
3)Design
4)Implementation
5)Testing
6)Maintenance
	1)corrective Maintenance:Correct Your Mistakes
	2)Adaptive Maintenance:Take it to the new platform
	3)Perfective Maintenance:Make it more perfect
